# CellLayers

Cell Layers is an information visualization study strategy for uncovering structure and knowledge in unsupervised single cell analysis. 

# Motivation

Unsupervised clustering of single-cell transcriptomics is a powerful method for identifying cell populations. Static visualization techniques for single-cell clustering only display results for a single resolution parameter. Analysts will often evaluate more than one resolution parameter, but then only report one.
