# Cell Layers: Uncovering clustering structure and knowledge in unsupervised single-cell transcriptomic analysis

## Motivation

Unsupervised clustering of single-cell transcriptomics is a powerful method for identifying cell populations. Static visualization techniques for single-cell clustering only display results for a single resolution parameter. Analysts will often evaluate more than one resolution parameter, but then only report one.

## Installation

## Usage

```bash
pip install CellLayers
```

```bash
docker pull CellLayers
```
